GYRO DRIVE PSEUDOCODE -- BASED ON JAMESHOLO
===========================================

motors and sensors setup ...

#include "joystickdriver.c"

int currentHeading; //current heading from zero of robot
int xPowerMod, yPowerMod; // amounts by which to modify x and y powers

#deadband ...
#single_bound_wheel ...

void updateHeading()
	add current rate of angular change to currentHeading

int getCurrentHeading()
	return currentHeading

void driveMod()
	use getCurrentHeading()
	calculate change in x and y to apply, based on currentHeading
		use tanx?
		not super sure exactly how this would look -- maybe subtract a percentage of the current x/y/zPower? or just subtract? or just take a percentage?

void drive()
	same as in jamesHolo, but apply xPowerMod and yPowerMod
	this is all assuming jamesHolo works

task main ()
	updateHeading();
	getJoystickSettings();
	drive();
